## Getting Started

To run the code, you must have npm package manager installed

Then, make sure you have all required dependencies installed
The dependencies needed and used are as follows:
```bash

    "bootstrap": "^5.2.3",
    "dotenv": "^16.0.3",

  }
```

If you need to install any packages, you can use the following command:
